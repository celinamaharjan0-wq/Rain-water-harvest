      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Nepal receives abundant rainfall (1500–3000 mm annually), mostly during the monsoon season (June–September). Yet many regions — especially the mid-hills, Kathmandu Valley, and mountain areas — face acute water scarcity during the 8–9 month dry season.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Rainwater Harvesting (RWH)</strong> is a simple, low-cost, and proven solution widely promoted in Nepal by organizations such as SmartPaani, ICIMOD, NEWAH, and various local NGOs.</p>

      <p>It helps families, schools, temples, and communities become more water-secure and resilient to climate change.</p>
